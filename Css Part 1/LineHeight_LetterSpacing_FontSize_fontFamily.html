    <h1>Iron Man</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. 
       Co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by 
       artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1962,
       and received his own title with Iron Man #1 in 1968.Shortly after his creation, Iron Man became 
       a founding member of the superhero team, the Avengers, with Thor, Ant-Man, the Wasp, and the Hulk. 
       Iron Man stories, individually and with the Avengers, have been published consistently since 
       the character's creation.</p>
    <h2>Early years</h2>
    <p>
        Iron Man's earliest stories were published in the monster-themed anthology series Tales 
        of Suspense. Marvel premiered several superheroes this way in the 1960s as superhero comics
        became more popular than traditional science-fiction and horror comics.Iron Man's first 
        appearance, "Iron Man is Born!", appeared in Tales of Suspense #39, released in December 
        1962 with a March 1963 cover date.Though the Iron Man armor was gray in its first appearance, 
        Marvel changed it to gold because of issues with printing.Lee initially delegated the writing 
        duties to other creators at Marvel, but he felt their work was substandard; as with his other 
        characters, Lee reclaimed control of Iron Man so he could write the stories himself.

    <h2>1980s and 1990s</h2>
    <p>
        In the 1980s, writers for Iron Man focused on the character's role as a businessman, 
        reflecting the economic changes associated with Reaganomics, and many of his challenges 
        involved threats to his company.[41] Denny O'Neil was put in charge of Iron Man beginning
        with issue #158 (1982). His run explored Stark's psychology, having him relapse into alcoholism
        and suffer at the hands of business rival Obadiah Stane.O'Neil wrote Stark out of the role 
        entirely beginning with issue #170 (1983), having him temporarily retire as Iron Man and 
        replacing him with his ally James Rhodes.Stark was relegated as a side character until 
        he returned to heroism in Iron Man #200 (1985).
